0.9: Added MaybeT transformer instance.

0.8: To fix MonadFail issue for GHC >= 8.6, runSupply and evalSupply are changed to return Maybe types.

0.7: Semigroup instances.

0.6: Reverted to Control.Monad.Error -- yields deprecation warnings but there is nothing to be done about it, yet.

0.5: Merged patch from Thomas DuBuisson, added instances for MonadFix. Also, at the recommendation of GHC, changed Control.Monad.Error to Control.Monad.Except.

0.4: Added Applicative instances for Supply and SupplyT.

0.3: Two new functions, added at the request of Stefan Holdermans at Vector
Fabrics. The first, exhausted, checks whether the supply is empty. The second,
peek, will return the next element without removing it from the supply.

0.2: Exported supply. Also added some monad transformer instances at the
request of ozgurakgun.

0.1: First public release.
